# Seize The Day

I have an image of a skull hanging in my bathroom with these words. Seize The Day.  What does that mean?  

You don't realize a day is important until the day after.

Sometimes, when things are happening, you don't realize that this thing will never happen again.  

You don't realize that every moment is precious.  

These words are precious. These moments are precious. Every moment will never happen again.  Where will you be?  Why can't I type well after more than 20 years of using this infernal machine, I still can't use it properly.  It doesn't matter how many times I type words, that are simple beyond mention.  I can never seem to type words properly with the appropriate cadence.  This is why I could never be a musician.  I could never just feel the music.  It doesn't really matter.  I can't keep typing. I wish I could.  I wish I could type with the speed of thought.  But my fingers don't work that way for some reason. I don't know if it's this over reliance on fluent typing with the combination of perfect grammar and spelling.  I am not a computer. I cannot just type good thought, that will make sense, and never need editing. 

Thunder.  Lightning.  

You have to have your computer with you all the time.  You have to be able to record the thoughts that you have, or you'll never be able to keep them.  They will always vanish. 

My value seems to be in writing.  I literally, somehow convince people, to pay me ridiculous sums of money, to type on keyboards for them. This is my vocation. I type.  I write.  I organize thought into productive art. 

Writing is the key.  Writing.  Typing.  Recording thought.  How well can you convey thought.  GPT-3 can now take thought and convert it into art.  What can we do with that?

What will we do with that? When we can make anything, what happens?  What do we continue to make? 

This is a writing machine.  That is it's purpose.  What kind of writing machine do you want?  I want his one.  As fast as it can be.  I like this machine. It's functional and pretty.  And I feel really good with this keyboard. I like typing on it.  

This is how money is made.  Words.  People type all the tine in text messages.  I wonder if we could write poetry, or sonnets, from text messages?

GTP-Human  

To diminish GPT-3, we must show how common it is.  

We have to create true openness, where every written thought of a person is automatically published, where the vast combinatory benefits of humanity can be showcased in relation to AI.  I dunno. maybe that would be a bade thing.  We could end up showcasing how simplistic humans are compared to AIs.  [Lee Sedol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sedol) showcased how even the smartest of humans, cannot defeat simple AI.  We have to move beyond our desire to beat AI at any game.  It will always won.  We have to discover what it is that we are inherintly best at.  That is being human.  

What is that?  

What is "human"? 

Violence, love, murder, deception, trust, greed, compassion, empathy, hate, lust, envy, ...verbs ...

Is that all we are? A collection of verbs? like somehow all we are are our actions?

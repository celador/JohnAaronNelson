4 Organizations tonight.  Speaking! 
Talk about Scale, what's the scale of the problem we may eventually solve. Talk with one another.  Find your shared interests, because these problems have a large scope.  Pathway to funding, with real dollars behind it.

#Donna Bailey, VP Corp Communications for EPB.
Heey.
She tells us about EPB.  We exist for this place, Chattanooga.  
Ubiquitous availability was a requirement for this area to grow.
Maximize and optimize it's performance.  
Capacity Management is the most important problem that the Power board faces.  
* Too little Capacity is a real problem.  They want to improve efficiency.  
* Too much capacity, problems with fixes costs.  

FLAT DEMAND
joke.. haha

Simple sketch of Grid Capacity.

She starts her script about power fluctuations.  Kind of like a children's story.  

* What if there were a simple, easy, and fun way to offer incentives to customers to even out demand?

$25,000 available.  UI interface, minimal internal software system. 4 weeks.  

* Is this a request for an App, or is it an off the wall idea like flickering the lights?

They say it will be wide open.... Application.. medium... 

Comparative incentive?

>Delightful

Nest question, we don't have anything , they're launching a product , a thermostat
>We want people to have something fun to do... instead of not enjoying their home...

*Activities*

*Make kids excited about science.*
We can do it with the community.  Take education to the next level.  

Spend the summer with the coLab, secured some funding, develop frameworks for implementing curiculuum.  Figure out what the scaling looks like, with subject matter categories.  Think about what the universe could look like  and how we would take steps towards implementation.

#Mike Bradshaw from CoLab
He's nervous

Entrepreneurial ecosystem: hard to see but beautiful and powerful.  How to create mre tools for entrepreneurs.  

Care and feeding of an ecosystem?
driver of local economies?

Visualization is key.  Data, we've got tools we've got beautiful computers in the sim venter and our pocket with the fastest internet in the world.  Shove data into it and get some pretty pictures out of it.
Visualizations.. 
Taxonomy of the ecosystem with support organizations
Seeing scale without detail still communicates a message.  
What about minute detail? RENCI and UNC, development of ecosystem, visualizations with a crazy API.  We have to look for new routes of power out teachers never imagined or were encouraged to avoid.  Drunk looking for car keys under a street light.  

Order out of chaos, mans new dialogue with nature, featured book.  Analyze data about a Entrepreneurial system.  

* Density
* Fluidity
* Connectivity 
* Diversity

It's amazing 
They need Research designers, Survey poll administrators, CS people

Trial and error is key to the process.  He has a theory about the way a community probes it's boundaries, that you use disruption to advance.

They want to understand how to drive innovation and create more entrepreneurs with fancy data visualizations and theories about drivers that can be derived from those drivers.  

He says Entrepreneurship has incredible value for the community.  This is philanthropy.  Rising tide lifts all boats.  Philanthropy given to enhance the lives Chattanoogans.  

>Show me the data!!!

The system is constantly moving.  Entry and exit of people has created a lot of interesting data.
Data.  
Who was with whom, when, 
It all derives from connections w/ time points... 
Enrich the data.  

More announcements......  Launch Tennessee and 36/86

Andreesen Horowitz, google ventures, lots of big names at this Entrepreneurship event. $199 to attend the event.

This entrepreneurship thing in Chattanooga is turning into kind of a big deal.  Lots of time for events at CoLab.

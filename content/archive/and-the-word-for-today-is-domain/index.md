Domain specific languages are colloquial containers of technological wisdom.  If you are a professional in a field, you use a domain specific language.  If you are a member of a specific culture or group, say a NYC punk rocker in the late 70's, you have a domain specific language. If you create anything of value, you likely use a domain specific language as the primary means to accomplish it.  

Documenting a domain specific language is like discovering the triangle or Ï€.  It is simultaneously the creation of something new and the discovery of something that has always existed.

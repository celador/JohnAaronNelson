## Day 3

Not so much confidence going into today's exercise after struggling so long with the buggy code.  Not really excited about debugging more code today.

So we start, we're going to use a light bar, neat.  And 10 wires and 10 resistors! Lots of manual labor tonight!

Going through the component information... this light bar is just 10 LEDs. Not special in any other way than it's 10 LEDs in a bar configuration.

We start with the circuit.  It's basically just the Blink circuit, 10 times.  We start with the code... Copilot fills it all in for us.  We upload it.  Bam it works!

Nothing else in the chapter!?

## Debrief

We did something simple 10 times.  With code we used a for loop.  Not super groundbreaking stuff today.

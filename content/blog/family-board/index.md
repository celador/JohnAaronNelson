What do we need for a good Family/Group Electronic Bulletin Board?

- Event Calendar to share events and stuff... Maybe Google Calendar?
- Activity Calendar / Schedule (Work hours, workout times)
- To-Dos
- Grocery List
- Wi-Fi password(s) / More permanent notes
- Countdown to important events?
- Pictures/Slideshows
- People's location?
- Daily affirmations (SSCW)
- Upcoming Birthdays

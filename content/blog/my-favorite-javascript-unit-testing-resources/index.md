<p>As part of the CodeScience Delivery Team, we are faced with developing products for the AppExchange in record speed. Faster than fast. Cheetah with a jetpack&nbsp;fast. So you can imagine that we are always in the lookout for tools and resources that can help us deliver the goods for our clients. Here is a quick list of my favorite&nbsp;tools to help you accelerate your JavaScript Unit Testing.</p>
<h3>Wallaby</h3>
<p><a href="https://wallabyjs.com/" target="_blank">Wallaby</a>&nbsp;is an incredible tool. "wallaby.js runs your code as you write it."&nbsp;It can be used with a variety of editors, namely&nbsp;Sublime Text, Atom, Visual Studio Code,&nbsp;Visual Studio Standard, and IntelliJ. The great thing about Wallaby is that it puts line pass/fail markers in the gutter of your editor and runs your tests on every keystroke. It's kind of hard to describe. <a href="https://wallabyjs.com/docs/">But if you see it, you may understand</a>. It is transformational.&nbsp;Every keystroke, your code runs, and you're alerted if it's valid or not, and if not, what the error is. &nbsp;No more questions of "will this code run?"&nbsp;You know, every keystroke, if what you wrote will run or not. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mocha</h3>
<p><a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> - "The simple, flexible, and fun testing framework."&nbsp; This tool is mainly used as the test runner.&nbsp;It has a great set of defaults, which means the&nbsp;no config&nbsp;OOTB is pretty great.&nbsp;It has a debug version,&nbsp;_mocha,&nbsp;which allows you to debug your tests.&nbsp;With&nbsp;<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging">Visual&nbsp;Studio&nbsp;Code</a>&nbsp;you can write and debug your tests with breakpoints in the IDE.</p>

<h3>Chai</h3>
<p><a href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a> - "Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for&nbsp;<span class="redactor-unlink">node</span>&nbsp;and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework." Chai pairs wonderfully with Mocha and&nbsp;has a great <a href="http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/">BDD</a> assertion style&nbsp;that is very flexible and expressive work chains. It also has a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/domenic/chai-as-promised">chai-as-promised</a> extension that allows for assertions to be done as part of a promise chain. For those of us who love <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promises</a>, it's a great thing.</p>

<h3>Webdriver.io</h3>
<p><a href="http://webdriver.io/">Webdriver.io</a> provides Selenium bindings for <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> - in other words, you can drive a web browser with JavaScript.&nbsp;It's pretty cool. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Intern / Chimp</h3>
<p><a href="https://theintern.github.io/">Intern</a> / <a href="https://chimp.readme.io/">Chimp</a> are two testing meta-frameworks.&nbsp;What is a meta-framework you ask? Testing meta-frameworks are tools that combine other tools and testing frameworks into a more coherent and cohesive package. If you aren't very well experienced with testing tools, these all-in-one meta-frameworks help you get Selenium, PhantomJS, Mocha, etc... setup easily. Chimp is my personal favorite. The guy who runs it is fantastic. &nbsp;<span></span></p>

<h3>Cucumber.js</h3>
<p><a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/javascript">Cucumber.js</a> is Cucumber for JavaScript. Cucumber is a technology that uses <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin">Gherkin</a> to express tests in natural language, most often used in Behavior Driven Development methodologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, all of these tools work great with&nbsp;<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and Visual Studio Code works great with Salesforce via <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnAaronNelson.ForceCode">ForceCode</a>.&nbsp;</p>

## Navigating team friction - 10:10 - Lara Hogan

###### Tue Jun 11 10:16:25 BST 2019

Surgeons...
Study about surgery outcomes.  Surgeons improve the better they get at their home hospital.
Familiarity with the team and processes has more to do with how good they are at their hob.
Teams are important.
She talked about her journey from front end dev to manager with increasing responsibilities
IT is a privilege to come together with a team to ship stuff
Tuckman's stages of group development
Forming - Comes together in a new state.  Team norms haven't been ironed out
Storming - Friction happens.  
Norming - Things iron themselves out.  Individuals iron out differences
Performing - Where Flow happens
Every time changes happen, a new cycle can re-start

Storming can be so frustrating
This is the critical step

1 Brains - Prefrontal cortex... deep complex problem solving.  Amygdala - threats and rewards.  IF there are threats, it tells the prefrontal cortex to shut down.  Our Amygdala acts fast, so it shuts down the reasoning part of our brain.  

6 core needs to feel safe and comfortable at work - [BICEPS](bit.ly/biceps-core-needs)

1) Belonging - Community, connection.  We don't want to feel left out.  It can be just as threatening as physical pain.
2) Improvement or progress towards a goal.  We need to feel like we're contributing to the overall 
3) Choice.  Flexibility, autonomy, decision making.  Balance is important
4) Equality or fairness.  When things aren't fair, we riot.
5) Predictability.  Balance here is important.  
6) Significance - We need status and recognition

Story time... "Desk moves" can be stressful and challenge all of these core needs
Understanding core needs is a "superpower"
Core need changes lead to Storming
Feedback leads to norming

2 Feeback - [Feedback equation](bit.ly/FeedbackEquation)

1) Observation of a behavior - Factual observation
2) Impact of behavior - Share how you feel in a way that they care about.  Talk to them about what they care about and help them learn how to achieve that.  Help them impact their goals.
3) Question ~or Request~ - Ask a genuine and curious open question about why they are doing that, don't request a specific behavior.

Think about the preferred medium. Usually verbal, often textual.  Let the person receiving the feedback choose their preferred method.  

3 Team Processes - leads to performing
Iterate on the processes to make sure they're working for everyone
Retros are important!  Normalizes talking about team health. When the hard stuff is met with understanding, it helps people feel acknowledged.  
Have a living document that states the expectations and processes of the team
Team Charter
Have a vision statement for the charter provides a "north star"

Engineering Manager - Tech Lead - Product Manager 
overlap of these three drives the "why"

Product Manager and Tech Lead scope and estimate product work

Take care of yourself if things don't seem to be improving.  You can't solve unhealthy or unsafe environments.  Talk to someone you trust about what you've tried and need.

This is a cycle.  Iterate and improve.

## I can’t do that for you Dave: undefined is not a function - 10:40 - Asim Hussain

###### Tue Jun 11 10:46:26 BST 2019 

Projects - @aijavascript / https://aijs.rocks

TheMojifier - convert a face to an emoji - How to calculate emotion...
"The face api" provided by Microsoft

Tensorflow - find a picture from unsplash
tensorflow.js
import * as tf from tfjs...
Train models
Load pre-trained models
"Computer vision" API provided by Microsoft - provides a human readable description of an image
Halt and catch fire

Image2image
draw an image and it completes it

We're not too far off from having a description of an app and having it auto-generated.  
It's going to be more important to understand how to lead teams that create solutions... less important to write code

## Engage teams to achieve high performance - 10:50 - José Caldeira

###### Tue Jun 11 10:57:12 BST 2019

5 steps to high performance
Memorable goals
Creativity through constraints
Autonomy with principles
Motivation by pitching
Engagement through stories

1) Goal - OKR/KPI/Whatevers - It's important to have goals (sports psychology)
Bold not reckless
Crisp not fuzzy
Impact not vanity
Simple not complex

Have them be yes/no or straightforward objectives  - easy to remember and keep in mind

2) Constraints
Embrace, don't fight them
Impose, don't wait
Mandatory, not optional

3) Principles
Options not restrictions
Align don't impose
Focus not an obstacle
Fast not slow

4) Pitch - We need to sell everything to everyone all the time.  Promote, promote, promote
Energize don't discourage
Promote don't wait
Consistent not occasional

5) Storytelling - Our brains work on stories
Empathy not a report
Path not the result
Truth don't lie


## Bottoms up with OKRs - 11:00 - Whitney O'Banner - Braintree

###### Tue Jun 11 11:08:25 BST 2019 - Start

"Google got it wrong" - video "How Google sets goals: OKRs"
Objectives and Key Results
Set goals, Align teams, Track Quantify progress

We will (objective) as measured by (key result)
example... We will improve accessibility as measured by 75% WCAG compliance

3 key strategies

1) Skip individual OKRs
Try tasks instead of individual OKRs...   Get work done, not "objectives"

2) Ignore the metrics.  Ignore the numbers.  Don't set specific numbers... they're made up.
What we thought mattered, wasn't what was being measured.  SWAGs are specific but meaningless and arbitrary
After iterating on the goals, you can set more specific metrics

3) Avoid cascading goals
"Having goals improves performance.  Spending hours cascading goals up and down the company does not."
Stifles innovation because employees end up not valuing their own goals
Managers far overvalue their ideas
Employees undervalue their ideas

Take a bottoms up approach

###### Refreshments / Office hours - 11:15 - Lara Hogan, Whitney O'Banner, José Caldeira, Asim Hussain

## The developer’s conundrum: what on earth does it mean to build AI software? - 11:55 - Ronald Ashri

###### Tue Jun 11 11:56:56 BST 2019

AI is a bubble, but the tools and techniques are here to stay.
1) What is AI? - AI is a field of science that attempt to understand how intelligence works and validates the hypotheses by building models and validating them.  Virtual assistants, automation, prediction, autonomous.  Delegation of decision making to machines.

Agent-based engineering..SMART framework provides a set of abstract formal models to support the specification of individual agents.  

An entity is anything that can be described by attributes
An Object is an entity that has capabilities
An Agent is an object that has goals 
A Goal is a desirable state of affairs in the environments
A Motivation is a list of goals that describe a desirable state

A passive agent has a goal ascribed to it. It serves your goals
An Active agent decides when to activate functionality
A Proactive agent suggests a course of action or soling the problem 
An autonomous agent accepts motivations

Data-driven vs model driven AI
AI needs something to base the decision off of.  How to derive the model?

Design the model (Newtonian physics is a data driven model)  Applications... Traffic control, train scheduling, robotics.
Discover the model uses neural networks to derive a model from a set of data.  Learn patterns of behavior

Always must validate the model

"Apply techniques to enable capabilities (decision making) in support of applications (achiueving specific goals with self-direction and autonomy)

2) How do we describe and build systems where decision making is delegated to machines?
... ?

## Guiding self-organizing teams - 12:25 - Rebecca Hill

###### Tue Jun 11 12:26:40 BST 2019

Self-Organizing teams 3 parts
1) Self governing
2) Self forming
3) Self organizing
4) ~~Manager Led~~

Trust the team - Start with a proven structure first, then iterate and change what's not working
You will fail - learn from the failures together  ( "Use feature flags" was biggest learning )
People are unique, so are teams - provide feedback and challenge high performers
You can't do it all - Good leadership takes a lot of time - delegate what's not working 
Be kind to yourself and others - take time to give praise and positive feedback
Perfection doesn't exist, and that's okay

People come first.  They take time.  _They are work it_

## 12/10, Excellent doggo: the power of positive transformation - 12:35 - Heidi Waterhouse

Best first day talk

###### Tue Jun 11 12:37:18 BST 2019

PIP (start job searching now)
Heelwork to music (video)... Cue the dog! 
How do I get developers to write docs??
Behavior: A team effort to meed a shared goal.

Training Theory
Trainer rewards a behavior until the trainee does it spontaneously.  Then agree on a cue. 
Traditional training.. Shame, fear, threats, reprimands, electric shocks (Aversives)
Positive training.. Rewards, praise, excitement, teamwork, mutual care and goals
Corporate training.. Money, hierarchy, assumed shared goals, webinars

What causes a behavior? Goals + Action + Feedback
What is the atomic unit of a goal?
Have clear goals, respect others' goals

Achievable steps... minimum viable goal.. small steps

Rewards are what make positive training work - Learner chooses the reward
Ask "What do you want?"

Successive approximation
provide reward, but do it successively, in small increments... (dog running up wall)
"The power of positive dog training" read the book...

Don't impute dark and fuzzy motivations... Simple rewards! We decide what to do on a moment by moment basis on what we find useful, rewarding, or mitigating problems  -  Short term motivations are much more powerful

"Making work Visible" by Dominica Degrandis
"Accelerate" by Nicole Forsgren   

Scope - Delivery method - where to start - how much time - when are you done - how do I get it out
Make Templates!!

Exercise:  What rewards you?  Explain it.  Write it down.  Give it to your manager.  

Autonomy * Mastery * Purpose  "Drive" book Daniel Pink

Ethical implications of rewards.  Immediate, measured.  

Think clearly about everyone's goals.  Write it down.  Precise, actionable, testable, rewardable.  
Figure out rewards together and commit for the long term.

## The reality of testing in an artificial world - 14:15 - Angie Jones

###### Tue Jun 11 14:25:10 BST 2019

How do you test AI?  Common sense and Statistics...

## A team in ten minutes - 14:45 - Steve Williams

###### Tue Jun 11 14:54:36 BST 2019

Cynefin model by Dave Snowden

Diverse (skillsets) crew
Rituals, meetings, social element, shared experiences, enable constraints
Real world scenarios, create a list of organizational debt

## Level Up: Developing Developers - 14:55 - Melinda Seckington 

###### Tue Jun 11 15:06:02 BST 2019

Gamify development... 

Provide a mentor, have goals, share the goals.  
Give direct and timely feedback in relation to those goals.
Self Reflection.  Do retros
Provide opportunities to learn new skills.  Have "Clubs", groups, and meetups
Acknowledge people's growth - Salary reviews
Expose basic competencies and how they are used


"Difficult Conversations" by Douglas Stone
"Thanks for the feedback" by Douglas Stone


## What I learnt about hiring diverse teams from conducting a fully-anonymous recruitment process - 15:25 - Bethan Vincent

###### Tue Jun 11 15:44:37 BST 2019

Fully anonymous, register with mobile phone. Didn't fully solve the problem

1) People want to showcase soft skills, but it's hard to talk about in an application or resume
2) Jobseekers want human connection and to know what it's really like to work with you.  It's hard to understand the culture in a cold call, and even through the in person interview
3) Lengthy tests and at home exercises are not inclusive, because not everyone has tons of extra time to do tests.
4) Job listing is just as important as the application process.  People fill in the blanks with "doubt"
5) If we really care about diversity, we need to listen. 

## Volunteers, not conscripts: fixing out-of-hours on-call - 16:15 - Brian Scanlan

###### Tue Jun 11 16:26:09 BST 2019

On call is great because it connects you to your customers
On call is terrible because it's anxiety inducing

"Everything is broken all of the time"

engineer count > 50 ..  Intrastructure, Email, Apis... too many people on call
Inconsistent quality and experience, on call eating the enginners

Made On Call "opt in" - virtual team of volunteers

Teraform and Github flow

We wrote standards and invented new processes, using Github for alarms and had a Runbook
The virtual on call team was only for on hours, not out of hours
On Call for 1 week, Friday evening to Friday morning
Escalation via an on call engineering leader
On call people should only do first aid, not real systems work, the engineering leader picks who to fix the issue
Remunerated for each on call shift, paged or not
Rest if you need to..
"By the book" escalations were uncommon, more informally through people available on Slack
Teams took ownership of alarms that caused pages
No one want to get people outside of their team out of bed, but not an issue with waking your own team
Rotating people through the team worked, people volunteered.  People wanted to go on call... because they were getting paid..?
Pages dropped to < 10 pages per month
Having SF and UK engineers being involved was really nice
Monthly communications about how things were going... Feedback is important
Recognition during reviews was helpful

"Human Ops" not SysOps

Takeaways..
Challenge the on call setup
In depth experts for every part of the system do not need to be on call.  Allow for docs, escalation and processes to fill in the gaps
Understand your customers, but optimize for your employees
Remove a lot of your alarms, review all the alarms.  Add in choke-points to new alarms

## Give 10%, get 110% - 16:45 - Kate Beard - Jr dev from FT

###### Tue Jun 11 16:56:27 BST 2019

10% time... do your own thing with the purpose of career development
People who work on side projects progress faster in their career
Not everyone can do the side work, because they don't have free time.  We should be okay with people not working 60 hours a week.
"Drive" by Daniel Pink - Autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

Junior Squad - to support and encourage jr devs to use the 10% time
10% time for talks and organizaing meetups, changing teams and advancing you career

Takeaways
Provide structure to support and encourage use of 10% time
Communicate about what's being done during the time
Let people do what they're inspired to do.  

## Eiffel's Tower - 16:55 - Nickolas Means - ManagingUp.show

story time...

Politics

We should participate in office politics, because that's how things get done.
You can't escape politics

Anytime you have more than one person working on something, you will have politics.
Politics is how people work together.
Every organization is political.

Politics doesn't have to be gross.

Eiffel did networking and self-promotion in order to get his tower built

Politics is "Making friends and telling stores"

Maybe you'll make friends with someone who has power some day, maybe not.  But it's good nevertheless

Tell stories.  You have to show what you've been doing, in a way that makes

Finally.. Negotiation.. or Cooperation

Cooperate with everyone so everyone gets what they wants.

"You can negotiate anything" by Herb Cohen

Bad politics is ... bad

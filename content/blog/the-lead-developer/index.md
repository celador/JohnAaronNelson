## Navigating team friction - 10:10 - Lara Hogan

###### Tue Jun 11 10:16:25 BST 2019

Surgeons...
Study about surgery outcomes. Surgeons improve the better they get at their home hospital.
Familiarity with the team and processes has more to do with how good they are at their hob.
Teams are important.
She talked about her journey from front end dev to manager with increasing responsibilities
IT is a privilege to come together with a team to ship stuff
Tuckman's stages of group development
Forming - Comes together in a new state. Team norms haven't been ironed out
Storming - Friction happens.  
Norming - Things iron themselves out. Individuals iron out differences
Performing - Where Flow happens
Every time changes happen, a new cycle can re-start

Storming can be so frustrating
This is the critical step

1 Brains - Prefrontal cortex... deep complex problem solving. Amygdala - threats and rewards. IF there are threats, it tells the prefrontal cortex to shut down. Our Amygdala acts fast, so it shuts down the reasoning part of our brain.

6 core needs to feel safe and comfortable at work - [BICEPS](bit.ly/biceps-core-needs)

1. Belonging - Community, connection. We don't want to feel left out. It can be just as threatening as physical pain.
2. Improvement or progress towards a goal. We need to feel like we're contributing to the overall
3. Choice. Flexibility, autonomy, decision making. Balance is important
4. Equality or fairness. When things aren't fair, we riot.
5. Predictability. Balance here is important.
6. Significance - We need status and recognition

Story time... "Desk moves" can be stressful and challenge all of these core needs
Understanding core needs is a "superpower"
Core need changes lead to Storming
Feedback leads to norming

2 Feeback - [Feedback equation](bit.ly/FeedbackEquation)

1. Observation of a behavior - Factual observation
2. Impact of behavior - Share how you feel in a way that they care about. Talk to them about what they care about and help them learn how to achieve that. Help them impact their goals.
3. Question ~or Request~ - Ask a genuine and curious open question about why they are doing that, don't request a specific behavior.

Think about the preferred medium. Usually verbal, often textual. Let the person receiving the feedback choose their preferred method.

3 Team Processes - leads to performing
Iterate on the processes to make sure they're working for everyone
Retros are important! Normalizes talking about team health. When the hard stuff is met with understanding, it helps people feel acknowledged.  
Have a living document that states the expectations and processes of the team
Team Charter
Have a vision statement for the charter provides a "north star"

Engineering Manager - Tech Lead - Product Manager
overlap of these three drives the "why"

Product Manager and Tech Lead scope and estimate product work

Take care of yourself if things don't seem to be improving. You can't solve unhealthy or unsafe environments. Talk to someone you trust about what you've tried and need.

This is a cycle. Iterate and improve.

## I can’t do that for you Dave: undefined is not a function - 10:40 - Asim Hussain

###### Tue Jun 11 10:46:26 BST 2019

Projects - @aijavascript / https://aijs.rocks

TheMojifier - convert a face to an emoji - How to calculate emotion...
"The face api" provided by Microsoft

Tensorflow - find a picture from unsplash

We're not too far off from having a description of an app and having it auto-generated.  
It's going to be more important to understand how to lead teams that create solutions... less important to write code

## Engage teams to achieve high performance - 10:50 - José Caldeira

###### Tue Jun 11 10:57:12 BST 2019

5 steps to high performance
Memorable goals
Creativity through constraints
Autonomy with principles
Motivation by pitching
Engagement through stories

1. Goal - OKR/KPI/Whatevers - It's important to have goals (sports psychology)
   Bold not reckless
   Crisp not fuzzy
   Impact not vanity
   Simple not complex

Have them be yes/no or straightforward objectives - easy to remember and keep in mind

2. Constraints
   Embrace, don't fight them
   Impose, don't wait
   Mandatory, not optional

3. Principles
   Options not restrictions
   Align don't impose
   Focus not an obstacle
   Fast not slow

4. Pitch - We need to sell everything to everyone all the time. Promote, promote, promote
   Energize don't discourage
   Promote don't wait
   Consistent not occasional

5. Storytelling - Our brains work on stories
   Empathy not a report
   Path not the result
   Truth don't lie

## Bottoms up with OKRs - 11:00 - Whitney O'Banner - Braintree

###### Tue Jun 11 11:08:25 BST 2019 - Start

"Google got it wrong" - video "How Google sets goals: OKRs"
Objectives and Key Results
Set goals, Align teams, Track Quantify progress

We will (objective) as measured by (key result)
example... We will improve accessibility as measured by 75% WCAG compliance

3 key strategies

1. Skip individual OKRs
   Try tasks instead of individual OKRs... Get work done, not "objectives"

2. Ignore the metrics. Ignore the numbers. Don't set specific numbers... they're made up.
   What we thought mattered, wasn't what was being measured. SWAGs are specific but meaningless and arbitrary
   After iterating on the goals, you can set more specific metrics

3. Avoid cascading goals
   "Having goals improves performance. Spending hours cascading goals up and down the company does not."
   Stifles innovation because employees end up not valuing their own goals
   Managers far overvalue their ideas
   Employees undervalue their ideas

Take a bottoms up approach

###### Refreshments / Office hours - 11:15 - Lara Hogan, Whitney O'Banner, José Caldeira, Asim Hussain

## The developer’s conundrum: what on earth does it mean to build AI software? - 11:55 - Ronald Ashri

###### Tue Jun 11 11:56:56 BST 2019

AI is a bubble, but the tools and techniques are here to stay.

1. What is AI? - AI is a field of science that attempt to understand how intelligence works and validates the hypotheses by building models and validating them. Virtual assistants, automation, prediction, autonomous. Delegation of decision making to machines.

Agent-based engineering..SMART framework provides a set of abstract formal models to support the specification of individual agents.

An entity is anything that can be described by attributes
An Object is an entity that has capabilities
An Agent is an object that has goals
A Goal is a desirable state of affairs in the environments
A Motivation is a list of goals that describe a desirable state

A passive agent has a goal ascribed to it. It serves your goals
An Active agent decides when to activate functionality
A Proactive agent suggests a course of action or soling the problem
An autonomous agent accepts motivations

Data-driven vs model driven AI
AI needs something to base the decision off of. How to derive the model?

Design the model (Newtonian physics is a data driven model) Applications... Traffic control, train scheduling, robotics.
Discover the model uses neural networks to derive a model from a set of data. Learn patterns of behavior

Always must validate the model

"Apply techniques to enable capabilities (decision making) in support of applications (achiueving specific goals with self-direction and autonomy)

2. How do we describe and build systems where decision making is delegated to machines?
   ... ?

## Guiding self-organizing teams - 12:25 - Rebecca Hill

###### Tue Jun 11 12:26:40 BST 2019

Self-Organizing teams 3 parts

1. Self governing
2. Self forming
3. Self organizing
4. ~~Manager Led~~

Trust the team - Start with a proven structure first, then iterate and change what's not working
You will fail - learn from the failures together ( "Use feature flags" was biggest learning )
People are unique, so are teams - provide feedback and challenge high performers
You can't do it all - Good leadership takes a lot of time - delegate what's not working
Be kind to yourself and others - take time to give praise and positive feedback
Perfection doesn't exist, and that's okay

People come first. They take time. _They are work it_

## 12/10, Excellent doggo: the power of positive transformation - 12:35 - Heidi Waterhouse

Best first day talk

###### Tue Jun 11 12:37:18 BST 2019

PIP (start job searching now)
Heelwork to music (video)... Cue the dog!
How do I get developers to write docs??
Behavior: A team effort to meed a shared goal.

Training Theory
Trainer rewards a behavior until the trainee does it spontaneously. Then agree on a cue.
Traditional training.. Shame, fear, threats, reprimands, electric shocks (Aversives)
Positive training.. Rewards, praise, excitement, teamwork, mutual care and goals
Corporate training.. Money, hierarchy, assumed shared goals, webinars

What causes a behavior? Goals + Action + Feedback
What is the atomic unit of a goal?
Have clear goals, respect others' goals

Achievable steps... minimum viable goal.. small steps

Rewards are what make positive training work - Learner chooses the reward
Ask "What do you want?"

Successive approximation
provide reward, but do it successively, in small increments... (dog running up wall)
"The power of positive dog training" read the book...

Don't impute dark and fuzzy motivations... Simple rewards! We decide what to do on a moment by moment basis on what we find useful, rewarding, or mitigating problems - Short term motivations are much more powerful

"Making work Visible" by Dominica Degrandis
"Accelerate" by Nicole Forsgren

Scope - Delivery method - where to start - how much time - when are you done - how do I get it out
Make Templates!!

Exercise: What rewards you? Explain it. Write it down. Give it to your manager.

Autonomy _ Mastery _ Purpose "Drive" book Daniel Pink

Ethical implications of rewards. Immediate, measured.

Think clearly about everyone's goals. Write it down. Precise, actionable, testable, rewardable.  
Figure out rewards together and commit for the long term.

## The reality of testing in an artificial world - 14:15 - Angie Jones

###### Tue Jun 11 14:25:10 BST 2019

How do you test AI? Common sense and Statistics...

## A team in ten minutes - 14:45 - Steve Williams

###### Tue Jun 11 14:54:36 BST 2019

Cynefin model by Dave Snowden

Diverse (skillsets) crew
Rituals, meetings, social element, shared experiences, enable constraints
Real world scenarios, create a list of organizational debt

## Level Up: Developing Developers - 14:55 - Melinda Seckington

###### Tue Jun 11 15:06:02 BST 2019

Gamify development...

Provide a mentor, have goals, share the goals.  
Give direct and timely feedback in relation to those goals.
Self Reflection. Do retros
Provide opportunities to learn new skills. Have "Clubs", groups, and meetups
Acknowledge people's growth - Salary reviews
Expose basic competencies and how they are used

"Difficult Conversations" by Douglas Stone
"Thanks for the feedback" by Douglas Stone

## What I learnt about hiring diverse teams from conducting a fully-anonymous recruitment process - 15:25 - Bethan Vincent

###### Tue Jun 11 15:44:37 BST 2019

Fully anonymous, register with mobile phone. Didn't fully solve the problem

1. People want to showcase soft skills, but it's hard to talk about in an application or resume
2. Jobseekers want human connection and to know what it's really like to work with you. It's hard to understand the culture in a cold call, and even through the in person interview
3. Lengthy tests and at home exercises are not inclusive, because not everyone has tons of extra time to do tests.
4. Job listing is just as important as the application process. People fill in the blanks with "doubt"
5. If we really care about diversity, we need to listen.

## Volunteers, not conscripts: fixing out-of-hours on-call - 16:15 - Brian Scanlan

###### Tue Jun 11 16:26:09 BST 2019

On call is great because it connects you to your customers
On call is terrible because it's anxiety inducing

"Everything is broken all of the time"

engineer count > 50 .. Intrastructure, Email, Apis... too many people on call
Inconsistent quality and experience, on call eating the enginners

Made On Call "opt in" - virtual team of volunteers

Teraform and Github flow

We wrote standards and invented new processes, using Github for alarms and had a Runbook
The virtual on call team was only for on hours, not out of hours
On Call for 1 week, Friday evening to Friday morning
Escalation via an on call engineering leader
On call people should only do first aid, not real systems work, the engineering leader picks who to fix the issue
Remunerated for each on call shift, paged or not
Rest if you need to..
"By the book" escalations were uncommon, more informally through people available on Slack
Teams took ownership of alarms that caused pages
No one want to get people outside of their team out of bed, but not an issue with waking your own team
Rotating people through the team worked, people volunteered. People wanted to go on call... because they were getting paid..?
Pages dropped to < 10 pages per month
Having SF and UK engineers being involved was really nice
Monthly communications about how things were going... Feedback is important
Recognition during reviews was helpful

"Human Ops" not SysOps

Takeaways..
Challenge the on call setup
In depth experts for every part of the system do not need to be on call. Allow for docs, escalation and processes to fill in the gaps
Understand your customers, but optimize for your employees
Remove a lot of your alarms, review all the alarms. Add in choke-points to new alarms

## Give 10%, get 110% - 16:45 - Kate Beard - Jr dev from FT

###### Tue Jun 11 16:56:27 BST 2019

10% time... do your own thing with the purpose of career development
People who work on side projects progress faster in their career
Not everyone can do the side work, because they don't have free time. We should be okay with people not working 60 hours a week.
"Drive" by Daniel Pink - Autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

Junior Squad - to support and encourage jr devs to use the 10% time
10% time for talks and organizaing meetups, changing teams and advancing you career

Takeaways
Provide structure to support and encourage use of 10% time
Communicate about what's being done during the time
Let people do what they're inspired to do.

## Eiffel's Tower - 16:55 - Nickolas Means - ManagingUp.show

story time...

Politics

We should participate in office politics, because that's how things get done.
You can't escape politics

Anytime you have more than one person working on something, you will have politics.
Politics is how people work together.
Every organization is political.

Politics doesn't have to be gross.

Eiffel did networking and self-promotion in order to get his tower built

Politics is "Making friends and telling stores"

Maybe you'll make friends with someone who has power some day, maybe not. But it's good nevertheless

Tell stories. You have to show what you've been doing, in a way that makes

Finally.. Negotiation.. or Cooperation

Cooperate with everyone so everyone gets what they wants.

"You can negotiate anything" by Herb Cohen

Don't be a "shit umbrella" be a "head shield"

## Flavours of technical leadership - 09:10 - Pat Kua

###### A+ talk

###### Wed Jun 12 09:11:24 BST 2019

"Talking with Tech Leads" by Pat Kua
[Tech Lead Course](https://thekua.io/techlead-course)
We all have unique flavors of leadership
You need to be comfortable in the way you lead

What is "Leadership"? The _ability_ to lead. The _act_ of leading a group of people.
Leadership is an action. **Anyone** can be a leader. All it takes is a single action.
Technical Leadership: The _act_ of leading a group of people in a technical act.

It is a shift in mindset.

We start off as a maker. We build things. We code.  
We need to shift from a _maker_ to a _multiplier_.
A multiplier has more impact.

Take implicit things and make them explicit.

talks about the "two track model" like we use at Clearbit.
He thinks we should change to a "Trident Model": Technical Leader, Individual Contributor, Management

Management thinks about people and processes
Technical Leader spends 75% of their time focused solely on technical issues.
Facilitate the right technical conversations.

Formal vs. Informal leadership.  
Formal is a given title, Informal is doing something without accountability.
Impact the different expanding circles of numbers of people

What do we do and how do we work?

4 specific flavors of technical leadership

1. Knowledge Cultivator: Fill the gap by helping people with papers, newsletters, blogging, talks, speaking. Sharing knowledge

###### Famen technique - explain it like I'm 5 to prove you understand things you think you understand

2. The Advocate: They have a lot of patience and relentless focus

- Solve pain points that aren't painful enough that someone else has already solved them.
- Draw on powerful questions. What is troubling you about "X"?
- Get buy in from others for a solution. Can play the political game.

###### Example is Continuous Integration solving the "Release team" problem

3. The Connector

- Companies are networks, not hierarchies. Networks are on any topic or area of interest

4. The Storyteller

###### The Eifell tower story is a great example. These are out historians and story tellers.

## ~~How to let go and get stuff done - 09:40 - Rita Mantler~~

## Inculsion stats with an I - 9:40 - Dora Mulitaru - @doramilitaru

###### Wed Jun 12 09:45:48 BST 2019

Being different is challenging...
Quotas are a bad thing because they provide false sense of success based on misleading metrics
But they may be necessary until we get to an equal world.
Demographics aren't binary, they are a spectrum
Inclusion is about intersectionality of these spectrums
Virtue signaling is gross
[HBS study](https://bit.ly/2vjcxTU)
Diversity is being invited to the party. Inclusion is feeling like you belong at the party.  
use textio.com to check bias
Sometimes the best candidate for the role isn't the best person to hire.

## Business as usual: how to stop drowning and learn to swim - 09:50 - Jonathan Stott

###### Wed Jun 12 09:59:48 BST 2019

1. The one with the problem...
   What is Business As Usual?  
    Bug fixing, legacy code, manual fixes, maintenance, critical fixes..
   often overlooked, delayed, or expensive
   a cause of stress
2. The one with the kiwi...
   The kiwi was the marker for the person with the responsibility for the BAU work
   They need support from everyone
   Never plan non-BAU tasks for the person with the Kiwi
   The lack of support made having the kiwi something scary and people would try to avoid it. Make sure they still have interesting work to do
   It's very hard to contract out BAU, so had to keep it internal
3. The one where you're underwater
   Keep things interesting for the one with the Kiwi and be nice to them
4. The one where everyone leaves
   What happens when everyone leaves, or the bus runs you over?
   The importance of the 3 "ations" Documentation, Simplification, and Automation
5. The one whwere the leopard changes its spots
   BAU became a toxic brand. No one wanted to do it.  
   Rebrand! Changed the name to "Support and Maintenance"
   Tone of voice is important
6. Where we fixed some things
   Consolidation
   Spend 8 weeks a year on this stuff (bux fixing, refactoring, etc.. )
7. The one with the new role
   Technical Support Engineer - main focus is to do the BAU
   goal is to automate themselves out of the job. Can graduate into a full engineer.
   Have fun! Allow them to have autonomy on what to improve.
   Effect is that it is unblocked the team.
   They still need support, mentoring.
8. The one with the cliffhanger
   Don't lose heart.

## Behind the scenes of an effective & inclusive hiring process - 11:00 - Ola Sitarska

###### Wed Jun 12 11:03:13 BST 2019

How to grow a diverse and inclusive engineering team from 10 to 35 in 12 months...

1. Define who the right candidate is and build the pipeline
   - Defining the requirements for experience and education can leave some people out that might be a good fit.
     - The best indicator for future success is past success in a similar role and environment.
     - Hire for the job you have.
     - Drop the specific numbered requirements, like years worked and degree
     - Describe what the job entails
   - Be transparent about what the job is, including salary
   - Build a representative pipeline
     - Invest in outreact
     - Have inclusive practices
     - Hire diversity in leadership first
2. Design how you gather and evaluate information
   - Phone screen.. In the first 30 minutes assess that the candidate is looking for what we can offer them.. Get them excited and set expectations
   - Coding Test.. Assess that the candidate can solve a simple problem that they'd find at work in a similar environment. Maybe have them do a code review.
   - On-site interview.. Gather evidence of them doing the job you defined
   - Fight your biases!
     - blind code-review in github - no identifiable information
     - objective evidence based scorecard
     - representative interview panel
     - ask for evidence from interviewers, not opinions
   - **Use the same rubric to evaluate candidates and current employees**
3. Setup your candidate for success
   - remember it's a two-way street. The candidate is also evaluating you.
   - minimize the stress in the interview. People perform best when they are not stressed
   - give timely, useful feedback about the interview

You've nailed the interview experience when they decline the offer, yet recommend the company to others.

## Mobile development in 2019: native versus cross-platform - 11:30 - Miriam Busch

###### Wed Jun 12 11:30:32 BST 2019

Alternatives to native

React Native - limitations and performance issues because of the cross-platform layout-rendering bridge. UI and Logic written in JS with
Xamarin - C# development for cross-platform. UI is written with native UI components with shared logic written in C#
Flutter - Dart, UI and Logic is shared. Rendering is done via Flutter. Flutter has their own UI components
Kotlin Multi-platform. UI is written in each native language, uses shared logic with Kotlin

Learnings...
Cross-platform made it easier to write once. But this came with it's own challenges because of the added abstraction layer.  
React Native is being deprecated at Airbnb
There's still no good solution.
They've chosen Flutter...

## Building security culture on infrastructure teams - 11:40 - Franklin Hu - Infrastructure lead at Stripe

###### Wed Jun 12 11:42:07 BST 2019

Security should be a design constraint.  It's everyone's job.

3 elements of security culture
1) Learning anb Growth
    * We don't want to shame people.  Shame causes people to disengage or be aggressive.
    * We want to learn, not shame.
2) Empathy
    * There are some instances where there are absolutes, otherwise we should exercise empathy and understanding about why.
3) Responsibility
    * Security is everyone's job.  
    * developers have the most context.  we should expect them to make the right decisions. 
    * use libraries to reduce decisions

Find security-interested people.
Rotations! Move people around so you can expand your context and domain expertise
Have Security Advocates or Security Champions.  Deputize them.  

Build a culture of learning.  Make space for learning.  Block off time on your schedule.
Discussion and presentation forums, like brown bag lunch.. 
Tabletops and Game Days.  Like a DnD game, but with work problems...
Pretend you destroy different production services
Have a shipped/Fixed channel in Slack; pre-shipped?

Process - Security Review - should not be stressful

## Why we should be scared of Shor's Algorithm right now - 12:10 - James Birnie

###### Wed Jun 12 12:02:47 BST 2019

Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm
Post quantum cryptography 

All your RSA stuff, while maybe secure now, will not be secure in the near future, and since everything is being recorded, it's not really secure now.

## Navigating front-end architecture like a Neopian - 13:30 - Julia Nguyen 

###### Wed Jun 12 13:27:18 BST 2019
__So yeah!__  x29

She's talked a lot about her story... her privilege, etc...  and more about what job's she's had, throwing around some jargon.

She's noticed that slow loading pages cause "problems".  Also, there's cache invalidation issues.

There's similarities with engineering! 

Good performance and accessibility is good!

"Spike is a term in Extreme Programming"

Have some Framework Criteria...

Vue won!  Hooray!

More Neopets talk

Chose React + Flow for my open source stuff.  "React on Rails" framework

Storybook is awesome.  We have a component library!

We have documentation!

Internationalization is hard, but important.  

She talks a lot about Neopets.  I've learned more about Neopets than I ever wanted to know.  Lots of Neopets and her teenage years.  

She was the lead engineer at Headspace... ... ...

Yay for greenfield projects!  She got to make a component library!

Now she uses JSDoc to write documentation.  

## How long is a piece of string: the key to solving the conundrum of software estimation. - 14:00 - Jonathan Rigby - @JonathanRigby

###### Wed Jun 12 14:06:37 BST 2019

Hofstadtler's law... #NoEstimates

Estimation is really hard.  There's lots of problems with it.

The key ingredient for estimation is trust

5 things to maximize trust

1) Make and keep the commitments you can.  Give quality demos
2) Be transparent for why we missed our estimation.
3) Don't overdo things.  Have a product mindset.  This is a business, not play.
4) Show empathy.  Product has stakeholders, like the CEO.
5) Educate them on the complexity of estimation.  Use a semi-outlandish example.

## Silence isn't golden, it's deadly! - 14:10 - Paula Kennedy - @PaulaLKennedy

###### Wed Jun 12 14:17:41 BST 2019

They have 30% of their team that feels they're not part of their team and they're trying to solve their communication issues with all hands meetings and retros.  

"Virtual off-site" where everyone gets on Zoom for an entire day. 

Google's "Project Aristotle"

Use "Active Listening" 

"Mindful Communication"  talk about the other person.. 

Have an Off-Site

They have a team mascot, which is basically like a Conch; "I have the Conch"

Don't have individual Slack channels.  Use public channels, with threads.

Book club didn't work.

OKR's didn't work, mostly because they didn't align with the actual goals

## Leading the team through a rapid growth - 15:20 - Joanna Chwastowska - Google Deepmind Health

###### Wed Jun 12 15:21:49 BST 2019

Be clear about the tradeoffs in technical design.  Be clear about how risk-tolerant and error-tolerant you are.

From day one, think about quality, security, and privacy on the system

Put the team at the heart of everything.  The team that is building the system is the most important thing.  

Hire Responsibly.  Never lower your hiring bar.  You will continue to pay the price the entire time.

Work in a sustainable way.  Burn out is very costly.  Should not have a "hero" mentality.

Monitor for your team's psychological safety.

Build mechanisms for the teams and roles to communicate across boundaries.  Make sure everyone has shared understanding about what we're building.  Communication from bottom-up is important.  

Takeaways - Be clear on the goal.  Communicate openly.  Hire responsibly.  Care for people.

## Facilitation techniques 202 - 15:50 - Neha Batra - A+ talk, should watch again

###### Wed Jun 12 15:46:32 BST 2019

1) Set the stage 
    * Use an agenda.  
    * Have a timeline and topics.  Lets people know when to speak up
    * Include breaks.  Guaranteed quiet time.
    * Set breaks after heady topics
    * Check off the agenda items
    * Come in before the meeting and setup with notes and snacks.
    * Make sure everyone has a seat
    * Talk about feelings with everyone sitting down.
    * Post it super sticky portable tabletop easle pad with dry erase board
2) Engage - Get people to have a rhythm
    * Split into pairs
    * Individual thinking
    * Share, voluntarily, individually
    * Write on a white board
    * Facilitating vs. Talking... just facilitate
    * Prompt on the white board for what to do. Have an alarm.
    * Align Roles

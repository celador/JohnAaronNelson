About a week ago I turned 35 and decided it's time to start living the life I want to have. As part of this, I'm going to give up my habit of unhealthy eating. 

My wife challenged me today to eat 100 salads for dinner before the end of the year. So along with my daily salads, I'm going to talk a little about my experience as a modern web developer. 

Where to start... I'm a developer. I'm currently working on an Angular project, using Typescript and VSCode. It's a joyous experience, it really is, and it's not all due to my amazing team. I truly love VSCode as a code editor. It is everything I've ever needed in an editor. It's damn close to perfect and getting better every 6 weeks. 

It's a strange world where Microsoft has created a best of breed application that is completely open source, built to be the ideal Angular editor that runs best on a Mac, using JavaScript. Five years ago, most anyone would have laughed at you for suggesting such a preposterous statement. Yet it is where we are. Technology companies can change. Things can get better. 

Reactive, functional, declarative programming is amazing. Angular w/ VSCode is the real deal. React and the constellation of related libraries get most of the mindshare these days, but I no longer have any more FOMO.
